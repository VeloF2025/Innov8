# Project Name Update Script

This script documents the systematic update from physical project names to generic project numbers.

## Changes Made

### Directory Structure Updates
- `velocity-fibre` → `project-1`
- `velocity-fno-2025` → `project-2`

### Documentation Updates

#### Company Overview (`companies/velocity/company-overview.md`)
- "Velocity Fibre" → "Project 1"
- "Velocity FNO (Fibre Network Operator)" → "Project 2"

#### Project Overviews
- `project-1/project-overview.md`: "Velocity Fibre" → "Project 1"
- `project-2/project-overview.md`: "Velocity FNO 2025" → "Project 2"

## Files Still Needing Updates

The following workspace files still contain references to old project names:

### Project 1 Files
1. `workspace/business-planning/VELOCITY_FIBRE_INFRASTRUCTURE_BUSINESS_MODEL.md`
2. `workspace/business-planning/VELOCITY_FIBRE_SEED_STAGE_BUSINESS_PLAN.md`

### Project 2 Files
1. `workspace/market-research/comprehensive-market-analysis.md`
2. `workspace/investor-materials/VELOCITY_FNO_TEASER_ACCURATE.md`
3. `workspace/investor-materials/VELOCITY_FNO_TEASER.md`
4. `workspace/funding-docs/VELOCITY_FNO_FUNDING_TEASER_PROJECTS.md`
5. `workspace/funding-docs/VELOCITY_FNO_FUNDING_TEASER.md`
6. `workspace/funding-docs/INVESTOR_TEASER.md`

## Update Guidelines

### For Project 1 (Velocity Fibre)
- Replace "Velocity Fibre" with "Project 1"
- Replace "velocity-fibre" with "project-1" where appropriate
- Update document titles to use "Project 1" naming
- Maintain project type description: "SaaS Platform for Fibre Network Management"

### For Project 2 (Velocity FNO 2025)
- Replace "Velocity FNO 2025" with "Project 2"
- Replace "velocity-fno-2025" with "project-2" where appropriate
- Replace "Velocity FNO" with "Project 2" in most contexts
- Update document titles to use "Project 2" naming
- Maintain project type description: "Fibre Network Operator (FNO)"

## Implementation Notes

- Generic naming prevents premature project identification
- Project types and descriptions remain intact for clarity
- File names may retain original identifiers for traceability
- Content should refer to projects generically as "Project 1" and "Project 2"
