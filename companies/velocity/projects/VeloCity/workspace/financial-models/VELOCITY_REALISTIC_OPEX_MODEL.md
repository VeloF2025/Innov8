## 📈 OPEX Scaling Efficiency

### **Comparison: Original vs Realistic Model**

| Metric | Original Y1 | Realistic Y1 | Savings |
|--------|------------|-------------|---------|
| **Per Project OPEX** | R1.977M | R400K | **80% reduction** |
| **Per Home OPEX** | R198 | R40 | **80% reduction** |
| **Staff per 10K homes** | 39 | 4-5 | **87% reduction** |

### **Scaling Curve (Realistic Model)**

| Year | Projects | OPEX | Per Project | OPEX per Home |
|------|----------|------|-------------|---------------|
| **Y1** | 4 | R1.6M | R400K | R40 |
| **Y2** | 12 | R3.05M | R254K | R25 |
| **Y3** | 24 | R5.36M | R223K | R22 |
| **Efficiency** | | | **-44%** | **-45%** |

**Hub & Spoke Benefits:**
- Senior management serves multiple projects (1 Hub Manager per 4-5 projects)
- Technical staff shared across hubs
- Bulk discounts on bandwidth, software, vehicles
- Customer service center handles all projects' customers

## 🔄 Contractor Field Operations Model

### **Pre-80% Activation Phase**

**Contractor Responsibilities:**
- Fiber installation
- ONT/router installation
- Initial customer setup
- Emergency repairs
- Network troubleshooting

**VeloCity Provides:**
- Network design & specs
- Supervision (part-time)
- Quality assurance
- Backhaul connectivity
- Support for escalations

**Cost Structure:** R60K/month per project (fixed)
- Contractor absorbs installation risk
- VeloCity absorbs customer acquisition risk (marketing budget separate)
- Incentive: Faster installations = faster to 80%

### **Post-80% Activation Phase (Zone-by-Zone Transition)**

**Shift to Performance Model:**
- R10 per activated ONT per month
- Example: 6K activated ONTs = R60K/month (same cost as fixed)
- Contractor incentive: More activations = more revenue
- VeloCity benefit: Link ops cost to actual customers

**Transition Timeline:**
- Project goes live → 6 months to 40% activation
- Month 6-12 → 40% to 60% activation (still on fixed R60K)
- Month 12-18 → 60% to 80% activation (fixed contract holds)
- Month 18+ → 80%+ activation (convert to R10/ONT model)

**Hybrid Scenario (Mixed Projects):**
```
Example Year 3:
- Projects 1-12 (mature): 80%+ activation @ R10/ONT average = R720K
- Projects 13-24 (newer): Mostly pre-80% @ R60K fixed = R720K
- Total: R1.44M/month for field ops across 24 projects
```

## 💰 Revenue vs OPEX Dynamics

### **Single Project Economics (10K Doors, 7K ONTs @ R10/day)**

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Monthly Revenue | R2.1M | 7K ONTs × R10/day × 30 days |
| Monthly OPEX (Y1) | R400K | Hub allocation + contractor |
| Monthly OPEX (Y2) | R254K | Optimized allocation |
| Monthly OPEX (Y3) | R223K | Full scale leverage |
| | | |
| Monthly Margin (Y1) | R1.7M | 81% gross margin |
| Monthly Margin (Y2) | R1.846M | 88% gross margin |
| Monthly Margin (Y3) | R1.877M | 89% gross margin |
| | | |
| Annual Margin (Y1) | R20.4M | Strong cash generation |
| Annual Yield (Y1) | 60.4% | On R33.75M investment |
| ROI Period | 1.7 years | Rapid payback |

## 🎯 Scaling Rules of Thumb

### **Staff Addition Schedule**

| Milestone | New Hires | Trigger |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Project 1-4 (Y1) | 15-25 core team | Foundation |
| Project 5-6 (Y1-Y2 transition) | +2 Project Managers | Hub management |
| Project 7-12 (Y2) | +15-20 people | Customer service growth, hub expansion |
| Project 13-18 (Y2-Y3) | +5-10 people | Operations maturity |
| Project 19-24 (Y3) | +5-10 people | Final scale |
| **Total Y3** | 65-70 people | For 24 projects, 240K homes |

### **OPEX per Additional Project Added**

| Phase | Incremental OPEX | Per New Project | Notes |
|-------|------------------|-----------------|-------|
| **Y1: Projects 1-4** | R400K each | R400K | Full overhead allocation |
| **Y2: Projects 5-12** | R215K each | R215K | Hub leverage kicks in |
| **Y3: Projects 13-24** | R180K each | R180K | Near-flat scaling |

## 📌 Key Assumptions Validated

1. **Contractor Model Works**: Fixed costs pre-80%, performance-based post-80% keeps expenses aligned
2. **Hub Manager Can Oversee 4-5 Projects**: Standard telecom industry ratio
3. **CS Scales Smoothly**: 1 agent per 1,000 customers is sustainable
4. **Remote-First Possible**: Minimal office space needed, hub-based as needed
5. **Technical Leverage**: Shared NOC, systems, bandwidth buying power = 40% savings
6. **Year 1 Achievable**: Lean team + contractor model realistic to execute
