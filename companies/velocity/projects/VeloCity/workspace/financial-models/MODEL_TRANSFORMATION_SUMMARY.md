# 🚀 VeloCity Financial Model - Transformation Summary

**Date:** November 2025
**Status:** Complete - Realistic Model Ready for Investor Review

---

## 📊 The Transformation: Original Model → Realistic Model

### **The Problem**
Original model had **unrealistic OPEX assumptions**:
- R1.977M/month per 10,000 door project
- 39 employees per project
- Linear scaling (4 projects = 4× OPEX)
- Single projects showed only 4.4% yield
- Didn't reflect Hub & Spoke architecture

### **The Solution**
Realistic Hub & Spoke model with contractor field operations:
- R400K/month per project (Year 1 hub allocation)
- 4-6 employees per 10K homes (not 39)
- Economies of scale (OPEX drops 44% by Year 3)
- Single projects show 60.4% yield at 70% penetration
- Matches actual operational structure

## 💰 **Financial Impact: Before & After**

### **Single Project Economics (10K Door, 7K ONTs @ R10/day)**

| Metric | Original Model | Realistic Model | Improvement |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Monthly Revenue** | R2.1M | R2.1M | Same |
| **Monthly OPEX** | R1.977M | R400K | **-80%** |
| **Monthly Cash Flow** | R123K | R1.7M | **+1,382%** |
| **Annual Cash Flow** | R1.476M | R20.4M | **+1,282%** |
| **Annual Yield** | 4.4% | **60.4%** | **+56 pp** |
| **Payback Period** | 22.8 years | **1.7 years** | **92% faster** |
| **ROI @ Year 5** | 22% | **302%** | **13.7x better** |

### **Portfolio Economics - Year 3 (24 Projects, 240K Homes)**

| Metric | Original Model | Realistic Model | Improvement |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Total Monthly Revenue** | R50.4M | R50.4M | Same |
| **Total Monthly OPEX** | R47.448M | R5.36M | **-89%** |

## 🏗️ **OPEX Breakdown: How We Cut Costs 80%**

### **Original Model per 10K Door Project**
```
Staffing: R1.072M (39 employees)
Operations: R186K (vehicles, facilities)
Technical: R158K (maintenance, software)
Services: R488K (contractors, marketing, admin)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
TOTAL: R1.977M/month
```

**Problem:** Every project needs full team. Doesn't reflect shared hub operations.

### **Realistic Model - Year 1 (4 Projects = R1.6M total)**

Per-Project Average: **R400K/month**

```
Core Executive Team: R107.5K (shared: CEO, CFO, CTO, Hub Manager)
Technical Operations: R58.75K (shared: NOC, monitoring, systems)
Customer Service: R53.75K (scales with customers: 5-15 agents)
Field Operations: R60K (contractor: fixed until 80% activation)
Marketing & Sales: R30K (shared across projects)
Finance & Admin: R40K (shared: facilities, vehicles, compliance)
Overhead: R25K (shared: software, licenses, contingency)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
TOTAL: R400K/month per project average
```

**Benefit:** Costs shared across hub's projects. Clear scaling path.

### **Year 2 Optimization (12 Projects = R3.05M total)**
**Per-Project:** R254K (-36% from Year 1)
- Regional hubs can operate 4-5 projects each
- Technical teams shared across hubs
- Customer service center pools customers
- Bulk discounts on bandwidth, software

### **Year 3 Full Scale (24 Projects = R5.36M total)**
**Per-Project:** R223K (-44% from Year 1)
- 5 regional hubs optimized
- Senior management shared across all hubs
- Maximum technical leverage
- Minimal incremental OPEX per new project

---

## 👥 **Staffing: From Bloated to Lean**

### **Original Model**
```
4 Projects × 39 employees = 156 people
12 Projects × 39 employees = 468 people
24 Projects × 39 employees = 936 people

PROBLEM: Unrealistic, expensive, hard to manage
```

### **Realistic Hub & Spoke Model**

| Year | Projects | Hub Structure | Total Staff | Per 10K Homes | Ratio |
|------|----------|---------------|-------------|---------------|-------|
| **Y1** | 4 | Hub 1 | 15-25 | 3.75-6.25 | 1:400-667 homes |
| **Y2** | 12 | Hubs 1-3 | 45-50 | 3.75-4.17 | 1:2,400-2,667 homes |
| **Y3** | 24 | Hubs 1-5 | 65-70 | 2.71-2.92 | 1:3,429-3,692 homes |

**Comparison:**
- Original: 936 people for 240K homes = 1 per 256 homes (insane)
- Realistic: 70 people for 240K homes = 1 per 3,429 homes ✓ Industry standard

---

## 🔄 **Contractor Field Operations Model**

### **Pre-80% Activation Phase**
- Contractor handles all installation, setup, repairs
- Fixed cost: R60K/month per project
- VeloCity provides: specs, supervision, backhaul, QA
- Contractor risk: Installation costs, project delays
- VeloCity risk: Customer acquisition, revenue

### **Post-80% Activation Phase**
- Contractor shifts to performance-based model
- Cost: R10 per activated ONT per month
- Example: 6K ONTs = R60K (same as fixed, but now tied to performance)
- Incentive: More activations = more revenue for contractor
- VeloCity benefit: Ops cost scales with actual customers

### **Financial Impact**
```
Year 1:  4 projects, all pre-80% = 4 × R60K = R240K/month
Year 2:  Mix of pre/post-80% = ~R720K/month (average R60K per project)
Year 3:  Most post-80% = ~R1.44M/month (24 projects at R10/ONT avg)
```

## 📈 **Scenario Performance - All Viable Now**

### **With Original OPEX (R1.977M/project)**

| Scenario | Penetration | ONTs | Annual Yield | Status |
|----------|-------------|------|--------------|--------|
| 6K @ R7.50 | 60% | 6K | -22.3% | ❌ Loss |
| 6K @ R10 | 60% | 6K | -6.3% | ❌ Loss |
| 7K @ R10 | 70% | 7K | 4.4% | ⚠️ Marginal |
| 8K @ R10 | 80% | 8K | 15.0% | ⚠️ Weak |

**Problem:** Only 1 of 4 scenarios shows positive return, most don't work

### **With Realistic OPEX (R400K/project Year 1)**

| Scenario | Penetration | ONTs | Annual Yield | Status |
|----------|-------------|------|--------------|--------|
| 6K @ R7.50 | 60% | 6K | 33.8% | ✅ Strong |
| 6K @ R10 | 60% | 6K | 49.8% | ✅ Excellent |
| 7K @ R10 | 70% | 7K | 60.4% | ✅ Excellent |
| 8K @ R10 | 80% | 8K | 71.1% | ✅ Exceptional |

**Solution:** All scenarios profitable, even at 60% penetration with lower rates
