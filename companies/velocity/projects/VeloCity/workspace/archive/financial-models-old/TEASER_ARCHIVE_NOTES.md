**Archived:** November 3, 2025
**Reason:** Critical factual inaccuracies identified during fact-check

## Issues Identified

### **Major Discrepancies Found:**
1. **Market Size Overstatement**: Claimed 5.056M households vs 4.2M actual township households
2. **Strategic Mispositioning**: Framed as asset flip vs long-term infrastructure yield play
3. **Pricing Model Questions**: R150/device vs R650-750 market ARPU needed clarification
4. **Adoption Assumptions**: 2 devices/person needed validation against market data

## Lesson Learned

All investor materials must undergo rigorous fact-checking against source market research before distribution. Strategic positioning must align with actual business model (Build-Operate-Maintain vs Build-Sell).
