## Cost Optimization Strategies

### Civil Works Optimization
1. **Micro-trenching**: 30% cost reduction vs conventional trenching
2. **Existing Infrastructure**: Share ducts with utilities (20% cost saving)
3. **Aerial Deployment**: Use existing poles where permitted
4. **Batch Operations**: Deploy in concentrated areas for efficiency

### Equipment Optimization
1. **Volume Purchasing**: 15% discount on bulk orders
2. **Technology Partners**: Joint venture with equipment vendors
3. **Leasing Options**: OLT/ONT equipment leasing to reduce upfront CAPEX
4. **Open Network**: Allow ISPs to co-invest in last-mile equipment

### Financing Structure Optimization
1. **Vendor Financing**: Equipment vendor financing (0-2% interest)
2. **Government Grants**: Digital infrastructure funding programs
3. **Infrastructure Bonds**: Municipal infrastructure bonds
4. **Equity Partnerships**: Strategic investor participation

## Sensitivity Analysis

### Best Case Scenario (20% Cost Reduction)
- **Unit Cost per Home**: R4,000
- **Total 7-Year CAPEX**: R2.3 billion

### Base Case Scenario (Current Estimates)
- **Unit Cost per Home**: R5,000
- **Total 7-Year CAPEX**: R2.85 billion
- **Drivers**: Standard industry costs, moderate efficiency

### Worst Case Scenario (25% Cost Increase)
- **Unit Cost per Home**: R6,250
- **Total 7-Year CAPEX**: R3.6 billion
- **Drivers**: Regulatory delays, complex civil works, inflation

## CAPEX Funding Timeline

### Year 1 Funding Requirements
- **Q1**: R50 million (planning, permits, team setup)
- **Q2**: R60 million (civil works commencement)
- **Q3**: R80 million (major deployment activities)
