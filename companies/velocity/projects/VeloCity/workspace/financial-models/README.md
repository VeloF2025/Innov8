## 🎯 Model Evolution Summary

### **Original Model (Archived)**
- **Problem:** R1.977M/month OPEX per project was unrealistic
- **Assumption:** 39 full-time employees per 10K door project
- **Implication:** 156 people for 4 projects, 936 for 24 projects
- **Result:** Single projects showed only 4.4% yield (not viable)
- **Portfolio yield:** 28.9% Year 3 (weak by infrastructure standards)

### **Realistic Model (MASTER)**
- **Solution:** Hub & Spoke architecture with shared management
- **Assumption:** 4-6 employees per 10K homes, shared across hub
- **Implication:** Only 15-25 people for 4 projects, 65-70 for 24 projects
- **Result:** Single projects show 60.4% yield (exceptional returns)
- **Portfolio yield:** 66.7% Year 3 (strong infrastructure investment)

## 🔄 Key Model Features

### **1. Hub & Spoke Operations**
- Regional hub managers oversee 4-5 projects each
- Shared technical, financial, and customer service teams
- Single management layer across portfolio
- Scales efficiently as projects are added

### **2. Contractor Field Operations**
**Pre-80% Activation Phase:**
- Fixed cost: R60K/month per project
- Contractor absorbs installation and field labor costs
- VeloCity provides: specs, supervision, backhaul, QA

**Post-80% Activation Phase:**
- Performance-based: R10 per activated ONT per month
- Aligns contractor incentives with customer activations
- Scales costs with actual revenue

### **3. Revenue Model**
- Daily rate per activated ONT: R2.50 → R10.00/day (4 tiers)
- Monthly revenue = (Daily Rate) × (# ONTs) × 30 days
- Example: 7K ONTs @ R10/day = R2.1M/month

### **4. Penetration Rates**
- **Conservative:** 60% (6K ONTs on 10K door project)
- **Base Case:** 70% (7K ONTs) ← Primary scenario
- **Optimistic:** 80% (8K ONTs)
