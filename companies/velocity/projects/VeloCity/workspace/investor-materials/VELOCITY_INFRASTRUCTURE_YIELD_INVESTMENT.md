## 💰 **Financial Model - Realistic Hub & Spoke Operations**

### **Phase 1: Infrastructure Build (Months 1-9)**
**CAPEX Investment: R33.75 million per 10,000 door project**
```
Network Infrastructure: R20.7 million (61.3%)
- Installation: R16.2 million (6,000 homes at R2,700 each)
- Equipment: R4.5 million (routers/ONTs at R750 each)

Fixed Infrastructure: R13.05 million (38.7%)
- Core Network: R12.0 million (GPON architecture)
- Backhaul: R0.25 million (high-capacity connection)
- Launch: R0.8 million (setup/compliance)
```

### **Phase 2: Revenue Model - ONT-Based Daily Rates**

**Single Project Revenue Structure (10,000 door deployment)**

Revenue calculated as: **Daily Rate per ONT × Number of ONTs × 30 days/month**

| ONT Count | R2.50/day | R5.00/day | R7.50/day | R10.00/day |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **6,000 ONTs (60%)** | R450K/mo | R900K/mo | R1.35M/mo | R1.8M/mo |
| **7,000 ONTs (70%)** | R525K/mo | R1.05M/mo | R1.575M/mo | R2.1M/mo |
| **8,000 ONTs (80%)** | R600K/mo | R1.2M/mo | R1.8M/mo | R2.4M/mo |

### **Phase 3: Lean Operating Model - Hub & Spoke + Contractor Field Ops**

**Hub & Spoke Architecture Benefits:**
- Multiple projects share: Regional hub managers, technical teams, finance, customer service
- Contractor field operations: Fixed cost pre-80% activation, then performance-based R10/ONT
- Remote-first: Minimal office footprint, hub-based coordination
- Scaling efficiency: OPEX per project drops 44% by Year 3

**Monthly Operations (Year 1 Model - 4 Projects = R1.6M total)**
```
Core Executive Team: R430K (CEO, CFO, CTO, Hub Manager, Project Support)
Technical Operations: R235K (NOC, network monitoring, systems)
Customer Service: R215K (CS team, billing, customer onboarding - scales with customers)
Field Operations: R240K (Contractor: R60K per project, or R10/activated ONT after 80%)
Marketing & Sales: R120K (Sales team, acquisition, community)
Finance & Admin: R160K (Finance, HR, facilities, vehicles, compliance)
Overhead: R100K (Software, licenses, contingency, general)
```

**IMPORTANT:** This R1.6M is shared across 4 projects (Year 1)
- Per Project Average: R400K/month
- Per Home: R40/month
- Compare: Old model was R1.977M PER project

### **Single Project Yield Scenarios (Per 10,000 Door Deployment - REALISTIC OPEX)**

**Monthly Cash Flow Analysis (R400K OPEX per project, Year 1 allocation):**
| ONT / Rate | R2.50/day | R5.00/day | R7.50/day | R10.00/day |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **6K ONTs (60%)** | -R1.250M | -R0.800M | -R0.350M | +R0.100M |
| **7K ONTs (70%)** | -R1.175M | -R0.650M | -R0.125M | **+R0.275M** ✅ |
| **8K ONTs (80%)** | -R1.100M | -R0.500M | +R0.000M | **+R0.500M** ✅ |

**Annual Yield on Investment (R33.75M CAPEX) - REALISTIC OPEX:**
| ONT / Rate | R2.50/day | R5.00/day | R7.50/day | R10.00/day |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **6K ONTs (60%)** | -37.0% | -23.7% | -10.4% | +2.9% |
| **7K ONTs (70%)** | -34.8% | -19.3% | -3.7% | **+40.9%** ✅ BASE CASE |
| **8K ONTs (80%)** | -32.6% | -14.8% | 0% | **+60.4%** ✅ OPTIMISTIC |

**Base Case Scenario: 7K ONTs @ R10.00/day (70% Penetration)**
- Monthly Revenue: R2.1M
- Monthly OPEX: R400K (Year 1 hub allocation)
- Monthly Cash Flow: R1.7M
- Annual Cash Flow: R20.4M
- **Annual Yield: 60.4%** 🚀
- **ROI Period: 1.7 years**

**Optimistic Scenario: 8K ONTs @ R10.00/day (80% Penetration)**
- Monthly Revenue: R2.4M

- Monthly Cash Flow: R2.0M
- Annual Cash Flow: R24.0M
- **Annual Yield: 71.1%** 🚀
- **ROI Period: 1.4 years**

**Key Insight:** With realistic OPEX of R400K/project (Year 1), single projects become highly attractive even at 70% penetration. OPEX continues to decline as more projects are added (R254K in Year 2, R223K in Year 3).

## 🏗️ **20,000 Door Project Scenarios**

For larger township deployments, the same economics scale proportionally:

**20K Door @ 60% Penetration = 12K ONTs**
| Daily Rate | Monthly Revenue | Monthly OPEX | Monthly Cash Flow | Annual Yield |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------|-------------------|--------------|
| R10.00/day | R3.6M | R3.954M | -R0.354M | -2.1% |

**20K Door @ 70% Penetration = 14K ONTs**
| Daily Rate | Monthly Revenue | Monthly OPEX | Monthly Cash Flow | Annual Yield |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------|-------------------|--------------|
| R10.00/day | R4.2M | R3.954M | +R0.246M | **+7.3%** |

**20K Door @ 80% Penetration = 16K ONTs**
| Daily Rate | Monthly Revenue | Monthly OPEX | Monthly Cash Flow | Annual Yield |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------|-------------------|--------------|
| R10.00/day | R4.8M | R3.954M | +R0.846M | **+25.1%** |

**Note:** 20K door projects have proportionally higher OPEX but significantly better yields due to operational leverage. OPEX scales to ~R3.954M instead of doubling.

## 📈 **Penetration Rate Impact Summary**

| Project Type | Penetration | ONTs | Revenue @ R10/day | Yield |
|-------------|-------------|------|------------------|-------|
| **10K Door** | 60% | 6K | R1.8M | -6.3% |

| **20K Door** | 70% | 14K | R4.2M | **+7.3%** |
| **20K Door** | 80% | 16K | R4.8M | **+25.1%** |

**Critical Thresholds:**
- 10K door projects require **70%+ penetration** at R10/day minimum
- 20K door projects are viable at **70%+ penetration** with better returns
- Larger door count = better operational efficiency and yields
