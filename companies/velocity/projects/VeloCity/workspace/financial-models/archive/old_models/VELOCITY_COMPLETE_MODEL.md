## 📋 Quick Reference: Critical Thresholds

### Single Project Viability (10,000 Door Deployment)
```
✓ VIABLE:    7K+ ONTs @ R10.00/day minimum (70%+ penetration)
✗ NOT VIABLE: Any combination below R10/day OR <70% penetration
📊 OPTIMISTIC: 8K ONTs @ R10.00/day (80% penetration, 15% yield)
```

### Portfolio Performance (Base Case: 7K @ R10/day)
```
Year 1: 4 Projects   → 18.9% Annual Yield
Year 2: 12 Projects  → 22.0% Annual Yield
Year 3: 24 Projects  → 28.9% Annual Yield
Mature: 24 Projects (8K) → 39.5% Annual Yield
```

### 20K Door Project Economics
```
70% Penetration (14K ONTs) @ R10/day → 7.3% Yield
80% Penetration (16K ONTs) @ R10/day → 25.1% Yield
Better operational leverage than 10K door projects
```

## 💡 Strategic Insights

### 1. Single Project Dynamics
- **Only viable at 70%+ penetration AND R10.00/day minimum**
- Lower daily rates (R2.50-R7.50) are economically unviable regardless of penetration
- 6,000 ONT baseline is below profitability threshold across all daily rates
- Requires aggressive customer acquisition (70%+) for single-project sustainability

### 2. Portfolio Leverage
- **Shared OPEX savings are critical** - 15% → 25% → 35% reductions
- Multi-project model (Year 3: 24 projects) generates 28.9% yield vs 4.4% single project
- Economies of scale in management, technical staff, and regional operations
- Portfolio approach makes marginal single projects viable

### 3. Penetration Rate Criticality
- **60% penetration**: Every scenario loses money - not deployable
- **70% penetration**: Only viable at premium tier (R10/day) - minimum threshold
- **80% penetration**: Strong performance across tiers, ideal target

### 4. Project Size Advantage
- **20K door projects**: More operational leverage, 7.3% yield at 70% (vs 4.4% for 10K)
- **20K door projects**: Can tolerate lower penetration (69% breakeven)
- Larger projects reduce per-home operational costs through efficiency

### 5. Daily Rate Tiers Impact
- **R2.50-R7.50 tiers**: Economically unviable for any single project
- **R10.00/day tier**: Only viable tier, generates all profitable scenarios
- **Pricing strategy critical**: Must achieve premium tier adoption or face losses
- Suggests market segmentation by service level (basic vs premium)

## 🎯 Deployment Strategy Recommendations

### Phase 1: Launch (Year 1 - 4 Projects)
- **Target**: 7K ONTs @ R10.00/day per project (70% penetration)
- **Expected Yield**: 18.9% across 4-project portfolio
- **Total Investment**: R135M for 40,000 homes
- **Risk Mitigation**: Portfolio structure, managed growth

### Phase 2: Scale (Year 2 - 12 Projects)
- **Target**: Maintain 70% penetration, 7K ONTs per 10K door project
- **Expected Yield**: 22.0% across 12-project portfolio
- **Total Investment**: R270M additional (R405M cumulative)
- **Optimization**: Regional hubs, shared technical resources

### Phase 3: Optimize (Year 3 - 24 Projects)
- **Target**: Grow to 80% penetration (8K ONTs) as projects mature
- **Expected Yield**: 28.9% at 7K, 39.5% potential at 8K mature
- **Total Investment**: R405M additional (R810M cumulative)
- **Enhancement**: Service expansion, premium tier adoption

### Consideration: 20K Door Projects
- **Better economics**: 7.3% single-project yield at 70% (vs 4.4% for 10K)
- **Larger scale**: Easier to achieve higher penetration
- **Risk trade-off**: Higher CAPEX but better ROI
- **Recommendation**: Mix of 10K and 20K projects based on township size
